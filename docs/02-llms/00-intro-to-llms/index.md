Inspiration from the blog posts “The Illustrated Transformer” and “The
Illustrated GPT2” by Jay Alammar, highly recommended reading.

This tutorial covers the some fundamental concepts necessary to to study
of large language models (LLMs).

## Brief overview

- Scientific applications for language models
- General overview of Transformers
- Tokenization
- Model Architecture
- Pipeline using HuggingFace
- Model loading

I strongly recommend reading:

- [“The Illustrated
  Transformer”](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) by
  Jay AlammarAlammar also has a useful post dedicated more generally to
  Sequence-to-Sequence modeling
- [LLM Course by 🤗
  HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1)
- [“Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model (Mechanics of Seq2seq
  Models With
  Attention)](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/),
  which illustrates the attention mechanism in the context of a more
  generic language translation model.
