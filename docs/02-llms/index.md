## Overview

Inspiration from the blog posts “The Illustrated Transformer” and “The
Illustrated GPT2” by Jay Alammar, highly recommended reading.

This tutorial covers the some fundamental concepts necessary to to study
of large language models (LLMs).

### Topics

- Scientific applications for language models
- General overview of Transformers
- Tokenization
- Model Architecture
- Pipeline using HuggingFace
- Model loading

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques that focus on understanding and generating human
language. NLP is a field of linguistics / artificial intelligence that
enables computers to interpret, understand, and respond to human
language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples:

- **Classifying whole sentences**: Getting the sentiment of a review,
  detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is
  gramatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or
  not.
- **Classifying each word in a sentence**: Identifying the grammatical
  components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjectvie, …), or the named
  entities (person, location, organization, …).
- **Generating Text**: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text,
  filling in the blanks in a text with masked words
- **Extracting an answer from a text**: Given a question and a context,
  extracting the answer to the question based on the information
  provided in the context.
- **Generating a new sentence from an input text**: Translating a text
  into another language, summarizing a text

> world in the way that humans do. They are trained to predict the next
> word in a sentence based on the context of the words that come before

> they receive. However, they do not have a true understanding of the

> that is nonsensical or irrelevant to the input.

Even with the advances in LLMs, many fundamental challenges remain.
These include understanding ambiguity, cultural context, sarcasm and
humor. LLMs address these challenges through massive training on diverse
datasets, but still often fall short of human-level understanding in
many complex scenarios.
