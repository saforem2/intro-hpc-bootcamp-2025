## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques that focus on understanding and generating human language.
NLP is a field of linguistics / artificial intelligence that enables computers
to interpret, understand, and respond to human language in a way that is both
meaningful and useful.


The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples:

- **Classifying whole sentences**: Getting the sentiment of a review,
  detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is gramatically
  correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not.
- **Classifying each word in a sentence**: Identifying the grammatical
  components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjectvie, ...), or the named entities
  (person, location, organization, ...).
- **Generating Text**: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in
  the blanks in a text with masked words
- **Extracting an answer from a text**: Given a question and a context,
  extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the
  context.
- **Generating a new sentence from an input text**: Translating a text into
  another language, summarizing a text

While LLMs are are able to generate (what appears to be) human-like text, they
are not sentient, and do not have an understanding of the world in the way that
humans do.
They are trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of
the words that come before it, and can generate text that is coherent and
relevant to the input they receive.
However, they do not have a true understanding of the meaning of the words they
generate, and can sometimes produce text that is nonsensical or irrelevant to
the input.

Even with the advances in LLMs, many fundamental challenges remain.
These include understanding ambiguity, cultural context, sarcasm and humor.
LLMs address these challenges through massive training on diverse datasets, but
still often fall short of human-level understanding in many complex scenarios.
