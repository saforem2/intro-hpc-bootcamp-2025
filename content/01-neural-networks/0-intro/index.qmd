This tutorial covers the basics of neural networks (aka "deep learning"), which
is a technique within machine learning that tends to outperform other
techniques when dealing with a large amount of data. 

- ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**:
  - Introduce deep learning fundamentals through hands-on activities
  - Provide the necessary background for the rest of the project

- ðŸ“– **Definitions**:
  - _Artificial intelligence_ (AI) is a set of approaches to solving complex problems by imitating the brain's ability to learn. 
  - _Machine learning_ (ML) is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (i.e. learning patterns instead of writing down rules.) Arguably, machine learning is now a subfield of AI. 

- ðŸ¤” **Recap**:
  Last week, we learned about using linear regression to predict the sale price of a house. We fit a function to the dataset:
  - Input: above ground square feet
  - Output: sale price
  - Function type: linear
  - Loss function: mean squared error
  - Optimization algorithm: stochastic gradient descent

  This week, we'll work on a "classification" problem, which means that we have
  a category label for each data point, and we fit a function that can
  categorize inputs. 

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains thousands of
examples of handwritten numbers, with each digit labeled 0-9.

We'll start with the MNIST problem in this notebook:

Next week, we'll learn about other types of neural networks.
