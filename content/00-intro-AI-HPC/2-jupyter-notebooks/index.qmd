## NERSC Instructions

1. **Project Setup**:

   - Login to Perlmutter:

     ```bash
     ssh <your_nersc_username>@perlmutter.nersc.gov
     mkdir -p /global/cfs/cdirs/m4388/$USER/
     cd /global/cfs/cdirs/m4388/$USER
     ```

1. **Using Jupyter on Perlmutter @ NERSC**

1. **Logging In**: <https://jupyter.alcf.anl.gov/>

   Select "Login Polaris" and use your ALCF credentials and Multi-Factor
   Authentication.

   Some of the images below show "ThetaGPU" being used, however, similar
   instructions apply to "Polaris" or "Sophia".

1. **Server settings & start up**

   ![server options](../img/jupyter_server_options.png)

   You'll want to set your server options to the following:
   - job profile: ThetaGPU Compute Node
   - Sophia Queue: by-gpu
   - Project List: ALCFAITP
   - Runtime: can be 5 to 60 minutes

   When you click "start" you are submitting a job to the batch queue and
   waiting for the job to begin.

1. **Server shutdown & logout**

   ALCF's guiding policy is:

   > "We ask that all users follow good etiquette and be excellent to one
   > another."

   If you simply close your browser window, or logout without shutting down the
   jupyter server, your job will continue to occupy the worker node.
   Be considerate and shutdown your job when you finish.
